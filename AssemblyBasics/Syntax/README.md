As a quick aside, I will mention that the assembly syntax we are using is only one of many. In other syntaxes, such at AT&T syntax, the mov instruction would be of form ``mov`` ``[gsrc]`` ``[dest]``.

We are using the NASM assembly syntax because it is simple and easy to read. Intel syntax is also very common and looks fairly similar to NASM syntax. AT&T syntax is very common as well, but it looks very different from NASM syntax and personally, I find it to be very noisy and difficult to read.

Most handwritten assembly nowadays seems to use NASM syntax and the NASM assembler, as we are using.
